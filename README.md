# Discord Webhook GUI - Code Update Report

## 🧾 Summary 概要

The code has undergone a major upgrade from a simple procedural implementation to a modular, object-oriented, and asynchronous application. This report outlines the key changes and enhancements.

代碼從簡單的程序式設計重構為模組化、物件導向並支援非同步功能的應用程式。以下是主要更新內容說明。

---

## 🧱 Structural Changes 結構變更

### 🆕 From Procedural to Object-Oriented

* Old version used global functions and variables.
* New version wraps the entire app in a class `DiscordWebhookSender`.
* Code is now encapsulated and modular, which improves readability and maintainability.

### 🪟 Window Management

* Old: Two separate windows directly created with procedural code.
* New: Main window and message window are created through methods (`setup_main_window`, `open_message_window`).
* Added `center_window()` function for window positioning.

## ⚙️ Feature Enhancements 功能擴展

### ✅ Async Support 非同步支援

* Replaced `requests` with `aiohttp` and `asyncio` for non-blocking operations.
* Webhook verification and message sending are now asynchronous.

### 💾 Persistent Settings 儲存設定

* Added `.env` support via `dotenv` (for future expansions).
* Stores last used webhook in `config.ini` using `configparser`.

### 🧠 Message History 訊息歷史

* Introduced `ScrolledText` to show last 5 messages sent.
* Helps user keep track of what has been sent without external logs.

## 🖼️ UI Improvements 介面優化

### 🔘 Buttons & Inputs

* "Verify", "Clear", "Send", and "Back" buttons added.
* Input fields now have better spacing and labels.

### 🚪 Close Event Handling

* Adds `WM_DELETE_WINDOW` protocol to confirm before closing the application.
